A simple movie search app using the OMDb API.

## 🔗 Endpoints Used

- `https://www.omdbapi.com/?i={IMDB_ID}&apikey={YOUR_API_KEY}`  - Used when a user clicks a movie card to view more info.

You can get a free API key by signing up at: [http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)

  Replace this line:

## Responsive Design

   Cards and buttons have hover/focus styles for a smoother experience, and everything is easy to read thanks to thoughtful spacing and typography.
